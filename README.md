# Exploratory-Data-Analysis
The main goal is to conduct a thorough exploratory analysis of dataset to uncover insights, identify patterns, and understand the dataset's underlying structure. Used statistical summaries, visualizations, and data manipulation techniques to explore the dataset comprehensively.

Tools and Libraries:

●	Python or R programming language

●	Data manipulation libraries 

●	Data visualization libraries (Matplotlib and Seaborn in Python)

●	Jupyter Notebook for documenting your analysis



# Tasks:

1.	Data Cleaning and Preparation:

●	Load the dataset into a DataFrame or equivalent data structure.

●	Handle missing values appropriately (e.g., imputation, deletion).

●	Identify and correct any inconsistencies in data types (e.g., numerical values stored as strings).

●	Detect and treat outliers if necessary.

2.	Statistical Summary:

●	Provide a statistical summary for each variable in the dataset, including measures of central tendency (mean, median) and dispersion (standard deviation, interquartile range).

●	Highlight any interesting findings from this summary.

3.	Data Visualization:

●	Create histograms or boxplots to visualize the distributions of various numerical variables.

●	Use bar charts or pie charts to display the frequency of categories for categorical variables.

●	Generate scatter plots or correlation heatmaps to explore relationships between pairs of variables.

●	Employ advanced visualization techniques like pair plots, or violin plots for deeper insights.

4.	Pattern Recognition and Insights:

●	Identify any correlations between variables and discuss their potential implications.

●	Look for trends or patterns over time if temporal data is available.

Deliverables:

●	A detailed Jupyter Notebook file containing the code, visualizations, and explanations for each step of your analysis.

●	A brief report summarizing your findings, insights, and any recommendations for further analysis or actions based on the data.
